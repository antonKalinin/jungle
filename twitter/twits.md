Here is lazy thread about how I am learning #rust by making platformer game with @BevyEngine. Lets go!
#bevyengine #rustgamedev #rustlang

Short intro: being a JS/TS web dev for almost all my career last year I decided to dive into Rust. I though it would be fun: most loved lang 3 years in a row, proper types, new concepts. Naive me)

Having kind of huge cemetery of pet projects I knew that if I start creating assets by my own, it would be another headstone, so I found this super nice asset pack https://jesse-m.itch.io/jungle-pack by @Jsf23art.

There is everything you need to write your first platformer as I do: parallax background, character animations, all kind of tiles. Definitely worths a couple of bucks paid! Not an ad! (it is)
